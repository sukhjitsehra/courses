# Working with Python Jupyter Notebooks

## **Jupyter Notebook**

The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents. It allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more.  Notebook documents provide a complete, self-contained record of a computation that can be converted to various formats and shared (email, Dropbox, GitHub, etc.).

You can work with Jupyter notebooks in three main ways. The first uses Google Colab, which runs everything in the browser. The second uses Syzygy platform, that presents a pure Jupyter Notebook Environment. The last one is VS Code on your own computer with a proper Python environment. Both options let you run NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit learn and any other library you need for the course.

## Google Colab

Google Colab is the easiest way to get started because everything runs online. You do not need to install anything on your computer.

### Step 1: Sign in

Open your browser and go to
[https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
Sign in using your Google account.

### Step 2: Open a notebook

You can start in three ways.

• Click File, then New notebook to create a blank notebook
• Upload a notebook from your computer using File, then Upload notebook
• Open a notebook directly from GitHub by selecting File, then Open notebook, then the GitHub tab

If your course repository has notebooks, paste the GitHub link in the search bar and Colab will load them.

### Step 3: Run a cell

Click a code cell and press Shift plus Enter to run it.
Colab gives you a full Python runtime with popular libraries already installed.

### Step 4: Install extra packages

If a notebook needs a library that is not available, you can install it inside the notebook.

Example:

```
!pip install seaborn
```

### Step 5: Save your work

You can save the notebook to your Google Drive using File, then Save a copy in Drive.
You can also download it to your computer as an .ipynb file.

This approach is great when you want fast setup or you are working on a Chromebook or a system without Python installed.



## Local

This option gives you more control and is closer to how real projects are developed. You will install Miniconda, create a Python environment, and run notebooks in VS Code.

### Step 1: Install VS Code

Download and install Visual Studio Code from
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Accept the default settings during installation.

I have crafted a tutorial for installing vscode and setting up Python, to read click [here](https://sukhjitsehra.github.io/vscode/)

### Step 2: Install Miniconda

Miniconda is a small Python distribution that helps you create clean environments.

Download the installer for your system from
[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Run the installer and choose the following:

• Install for your user only
• Add Miniconda to your PATH or let the installer manage it automatically
• Accept default directory

Restart your computer after installation to ensure all paths work correctly.

### Step 3: Create a Python environment

Open a terminal. On Windows you can search for Anaconda Prompt or use Command Prompt. On macOS or Linux use your normal terminal.

Create a new environment. Example:

```
conda create -n mlcourse python=3.12
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate mlcourse
```

You now have an isolated space where you can install Python libraries without affecting the rest of your system.

### Step 4: Install Jupyter and common packages

Inside your activated environment run:

```
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

This installs the tools you need for most notebooks.

### Step 5: Install the VS Code Python extension

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions tab on the left.
Search for Python. Install the official extension by Microsoft.

### Step 6: Install the Jupyter extension

In the same Extensions tab search for Jupyter.
Install the official Jupyter extension.
This extension lets you open and run .ipynb notebooks inside VS Code.

### Step 7: Open your notebook

In VS Code go to File, then Open Folder.
Select your course folder or repository.
Open any .ipynb file.
VS Code will ask which interpreter you want to use. Select the Python interpreter from your conda environment.

For example it may look like:

```
Python 3.12.0 ('mlcourse')
```

### Step 8: Run cells

Click a cell and press Shift plus Enter. You will see output just like in Jupyter Notebook or Colab.

### Step 9: Install extra packages when needed

If a notebook requires new libraries, install them inside the activated environment:

```
pip install seaborn
```

Refresh the kernel in VS Code afterward.



## Syzygy


* [Syzygy](https://wlu.syzygy.ca/) is a joint project of the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS).
* It offers a free web-based Jupyter Notebook platform to universities.
* No setup is required; it runs entirely in Compute Canada’s cloud.
* You can write and execute code, save and share analyses, and access strong computing resources directly in your browser.
* Syzygy provides a *pure* Jupyter environment.
* It offers 8/16 cores and 64/128 GB for each university, partitioned between users via Docker.

::: {.callout-important collapse=false}
**Warning:** Syzygy gives limited storage to each student. Avoid uploading large files.
:::

### **Launching Jupyter Notebook**

* Access the Syzygy platform using the link provided on MyLS.
* This environment is integrated into your Laurier account.
* Create a folder named `CP322` on your computer for all worksheets.
* Upload `.ipynb` files to JupyterHub and open them.

## **Notebook Dashboard**

Contains three tabs:

* **Files** — shows files and folders under the current directory.
* **Launcher** — shows different options available to work in Syzygy.

## **Notebook User Interface**

It includes:

* Menu bar
* Toolbar
* Notebook area with cells

## **Notebook Area and Cells**

Notebooks contain a sequence of cells.

Types of cells:

* **Code cells** — executable code (grey). Run with:

  * `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` (run in place)
  * `Shift + Enter` (run and move to next)
  * `Alt/Option + Enter` (run and insert new cell)
* **Markdown cells** — narrative text with LaTeX (white).
* **Raw cells** — unformatted text included without modification.

Rich output (images, video, plots) is embedded directly.

## **Code Cells**

Ways to execute:

* `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`
* `Shift + Enter`
* `Alt/Option + Enter`

The **Cell** menu includes:

* Run Cells
* Run and Select Below
* Run and Insert Below
* Run All
* Run All Above
* Run All Below

## **Adding and Moving Cells**

* Add new cells using the **+** buttons between cells or via the toolbar.
* Move cells with "Cell Up" or "Cell Down" in the toolbar.
* Select consecutive cells with a lasso drag.
* Select non-adjacent cells: `Ctrl + Click`.
* Select ranges: `Shift + Click`.

## **Shortcuts**

* **Edit mode / Command mode**: `Enter` / `Esc`
* **Command mode actions**:

  * `A` — insert cell above
  * `B` — insert cell below
  * `M` — convert to Markdown
  * `Y` — convert to Code
  * `D D` — delete cell
  * `Z` — undo deletion
  * `Shift + Up/Down` — select multiple cells
  * `Shift + M` — merge cells

## **Text / Markdown Cells**

* Double-click to edit.
* Supports Markdown syntax.
* Supports LaTeX using `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display).
* Markdown spec: [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

## **Markdown Basics**

### **Headings**

Use `#` symbols:

```
# Heading 1

```

### **Emphasis**

* **Bold** — `**text**`
* *Italic* — `*text*` or `_text_`

## Which option should you choose

Google Colab is fast, convenient, and powerful. If you want to use alternative you can use Syzygy. VS Code gives you full control and is better for larger projects.  All methods work for every notebook in this course. Once you are comfortable with both, you can switch between them depending on what you are working on.
