    "You should become familiar with reading the comments within the Code cells. This is usually where instructions and explanations are \"hidden\" on how to get the function to work. A comment in the code cell is preceded by a `\\#` to ensure that the comment will not be read when the code is executed. To view the Python documentation for a function, use the `help` function. To run the below code cell, click your mouse anywhere on `print()` and use **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter** to run and view the function's documentation. When you double click the code cell, it would become editable and you can make changes and then run the cell using **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter**."

    "For quantitative data, we most often use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. Whereas, for qualitative or categorical data, we most often use bar charts and dot charts. As an example of the built-in plotting functionality of pandas, the following example uses `plot` method of the `Series` class to generate a `barh` plot type to visually display the value counts for `State`."

    "more variables. But one should be careful about using it on high-volume data. If there is too much data, the structure of the data may become difficult to see in a scatterplot a hexbinplot is sometimes a better alternative. A hexbinplot combines the ideas of scatterplot and histogram. Similar to a scatterplot, a hexbinplot visualizes data in the x-axis and y-axis. Data is placed into hexbins, and the third dimension uses shading to represent the concentration of data in each hexbin. It is used to represent the relationship of 2 numerical variables. Without overlapping the points, the plotting window is split into several hexbins."

    "Below are some of the plot methods from Seaborn library to create various plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distribution Plots: \n",
    "    - `.distplot()` is used to visualize the parametric distribution of a dataset.\n",
    "    - `.pairplot()` is used to plot pairwise relationships across an entire dataframe (for the numerical columns) and supports a color hue argument (for categorical columns)\n",
    "    - `.kdeplot()` creates kernel density estimation plots. These plots replace every single observation with a Gaussian (Normal) distribution centered around that value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Categorical Plots:\n",
    "   - `.barplot()` allows you to get aggregate data off a categorical feature in your data. barplot is a general plot that allows you to aggregate the categorical data based off some function, by default the mean:\n",
    "   - `.countplot()` is the same as barplot except the estimator is explicitly counting the number of occurrences. \n",
    "   - `.boxplot()`  shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of a categorical variable.\n",
    "- Regression Plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `.lmplot()` is the most basic plot which shows a line along a 2-dimensional plane and is used to see the correlation between two attributes plotted against the x-axis and y-axis."
