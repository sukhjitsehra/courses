## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the science \(and art\) of programming computers so that they can learn from data\.

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%293.png){fig-align="center" height=60%}

_Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\._

_—Arthur Samuel\, 1959_

## Machine Learning Applications

- Segment customers based on their purchases so you can design a different marketing strategy for each segment

- Suggesting a product that a customer might be interested in based on past purchases

- Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify

- Automatically categorize the news

- Automatically flag offensive comments on discussion forums

- Create a chatbot or personal assistant

- Predict your company's revenue for the next year based on many performance metrics

- Making your app respond to voice commands

- Creating a smart bot for a game

## Machine Learning Project Steps

- Seeing the big picture and understanding the project

- Collect data

- Examine and visualize data

- Fitting Data to Machine Learning Models

- Model selection and training of the model

- Optimizing the model

- Integrating the model into the system

## Big picture and understanding the project

- Define the goal in terms of business

- What are the current solutions/workarounds?

- How should you evaluate this issue \(supervised/unsupervised\, online/offline etc\.\)?

- How should performance be measured?

- What would be the minimum performance required to meet the business goal?

- Is human expertise available?

- How do you fix the problem manually?

- List the assumptions you \(or others\) have made so far

## Collect Data

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%2917.png)

## Examine and Visualize Data

It is the work that allows us to quickly recognize the data\, given to creating simple graphs \(eg box charts\, scatter plots\) that help to draw a picture of a data set\, along with summary statistics \(mean\, median\, quantities\, etc\.\)\.

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%2919.png)

## Fitting the Data to the Model

* __Cleaning and Editing Data__
  * Cleaning up Unnecessary or Non\-Informational Data
  * Fixing wrong data
  * Combining data from different sources
* __Determining Data Types__
  * Date\, Numeric\, Text etc\. checking data in formats
  * Performing appropriate data type conversions
* __Data Size Reduction__
  * PCA
  * Elimination of redundant columns and correlation analysis
* __Examination of data distributions and regularization__
  * Min\-max Scaling
  * Standardization

## Model selection and training of the model

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%2924.png)

## Success Performances: Regression Metrics

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%2925.png)

## Optimizing the model

- Fine tune hyperparameters using cross validation

- Perform hyperparameter searches\, gridsearch etc\.

- Try Ensemble methods\. Combining your best models often performs better than running them individually

- You'll want to use as much data as possible for this step\, especially as you move towards the end of the tweak\.

- Once you are sure of your final model\, measure its performance on the test set to estimate its generalization error\.

## Integrating the model into the system (Deployment)

- ML Deployment is the integration of a data\-driven machine learning model into an existing production environment\.

- The machine learning project developed in the test environment is made ready to work on platforms such as web services \(SaaS\, PaaS\) in order to serve the end user\.

- __Streamlit\,__  HTML or CSS etc\. It is an open source python library that helps you create interactive web applications without knowledge of it\.

- __Docker __ is by far one of the most popular ways for developers to containerize their code\.

- __Heroku __ is a cloud computing application infrastructure service provider \(PaaS\)

## Machine Learning Terminologies: Cross Validation

Cross validation\, also called CV\, is a method used to select a model that does not rely heavily on the initial training set\.

![](img/Day%201%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20%281%2930.png)

## Bias - Variance Tradeoff

__Bias: __ The bias of a model is the difference between the expected prediction and the correct model we are trying to predict for the given data points\.

__Variance: __ The variance of a model is the variability of the model estimate for given data points\.

__Deviation/variance Tradeoff: __ The simpler the model\, the higher the bias\, and the more complex the model\, the higher the variance\.

|  | Underfitting | Ideal | Overfitting |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Symptoms | Higher training error<br />Training error close to test error<br />High bias | Training error slightly lower than test error | Very low training error<br />Training error is considerably lower than test error<br />High variance |


## Tools Used in Machine Learning

__Python __ is a general purpose programming language.
__NumPy __ is the basic package used for scientific calculations in Python\.
__Pandas__  is an open source Python library that facilitates data analysis and data preprocessing\.


__Matplotlib __ is a data visualization and plotting library for the Python programming language

The matplotlib plotting package is one of the most important tools for scientific programming with Python

__Scikit\-learn __ is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language\.

It includes many basic methods such as linear regression\, logistic regression\, decision trees\, random forest\.

## Datasets

__Kaggle__  is an online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners\.

__UCI __ is the dataset repository provided by the machine learning and intelligent systems research center at the __ University of California\, Irvine\.

__Google Datasets__ Discover and access unique and valuable datasets.
