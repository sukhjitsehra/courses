title: "🗓️ Week 03 - Regression"
---

In this third week, we will cover linear regression. The true relationships between predictors and responses are rarely linear. But
linear models often provide reasonable approximation. They provide high interpretability and have low variance, mitigating the risk of over-fitting. Linear models
can be extended to include (some) non-linear relationships. Linear models also provide an excellent baseline to compare other models against: if our sophisticated model does not do much better than a linear model we might consider trading some bias for lower variance.
